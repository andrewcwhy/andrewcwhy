## 🛠️ Favorite Tools

If it’s fast, safe, and clean, I’m into it. These are the tools that I get hard for:

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) - an all-in-one JavaScript runtime and toolkit written Zig.
- [Moon](https://moonrepo.dev/moon) - A task runner and monorepo management tool for the web ecosystem written in Rust.
- [Proto](https://moonrepo.dev/proto) - A unified toolchain and version manager for all my goto languages and tools written in Rust.
- [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/) - Simple and performant reactivity for building user interfaces.
- [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) - Yeah, I use Zig's build system and cross-compilimation toolchain for C projects.
